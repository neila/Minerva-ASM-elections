# how the data should be structured:

- a single csv
- first column should be the class
- first row should be candidate names
- votes are done in ranked order

Questions:
- does number of candidates matter?
- number of voters?
- number of classes? --> should find the number of classes when running


# how the code should work:

- the path for the data as a csv should be selected DONE
- the titles for each class/cohort should be specified DONE
- and verified! DONE
- verify CSV - DONE
- verify the file is structured correctly.
- the code should run automatically from that point,

rendering the information needed and spewing out info.

- it should be possible to "turn-on" the full-data option

# code-related TODOs
- add a requirements .txt
- add instructions how to run
- add an example form / csv file


# UI:
- Ask for user input of N of winners DONE
- User input for first column with names DONE
- Show results in pop-up window
