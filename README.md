# ASM_Elections_Code

### IMPORTANT
Before using this to actually run an election, read the segment on preparing the data for processing. Results will be incorrect otherwise.

### Dependencies:
The code used by the ASM has several dependencies. These include 'python-vote-core' and 'python-graph-master'. These cant be found with pip, as far as I could tell, and we definitely should re-work them ASAP.
