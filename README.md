# ASM_Elections_Code

## IMPORTANT
Before using this to actually run an election, read the segment on preparing the data for processing. Results will be incorrect otherwise.

## What's In Here?
Exists:
- `vote-core`
> which is...
- `python-graph-master`
> which is...
- `asm_vote_counter.py`
> which is...

Missing:
- UI
> which is...
- Processing from Excel to csv
> which is...

### Dependencies:
The code used by the ASM has several dependencies. These include `python-vote-core` and `python-graph-master`. These cant be found with pip, as far as I could tell, and we definitely should re-work them ASAP.

##### Cautionary Note (Roiman, M19, 2019)
Honestly, I don't know all of the ins and outs of this code. It works. It worked when we needed it to work. But it's one of those "sold as-is" things. Schultze is definitely an awesome method. But maybe get some CS majors torebuild it.
