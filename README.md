# ASM_Elections_Code

### IMPORTANT
Before using this to actually run an election, read the segment on preparing the data for processing. Results will be incorrect otherwise.

### Dependencies:
The code used by the ASM has several dependencies. These include `python-vote-core` and `python-graph-master`. These cant be found with pip, as far as I could tell, and we definitely should re-work them ASAP.

##### Cautionary Note (Roiman, M19, 2019)
Honestly, I don't know all of the ins and outs of this code. It works. It worked when we needed it to work. But it's one of those "sold as-is" things. Schultze is definitely an awesome method. But maybe get some CS majors torebuild it.
